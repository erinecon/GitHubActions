## Release policy and schedule {#release-policy-and-schedule}

<Our charms do not typically have a defined release policy. Therefore we will define
a schedule at which we publish release notes, for instance, monthly or every 6 months,
depending on how often the charm is updated. Use this section to outline the release
policy cadence here.>
